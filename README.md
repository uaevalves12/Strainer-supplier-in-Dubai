# Strainer-supplier-in-Dubai
UAE Valves takes pride as a premier Strainer supplier in Dubai. In the realm of industrial applications, a strainer is an essential pipe fitting used to purify, filter, or separate liquids from solid matter. It functions as a sieve or filter, preventing solid bodies from mixing into a liquid stream or flow line. The use of welded metal in pipelines protects equipment and processes from potential damage, thereby reducing maintenance time and costs.

What is a Strainer?
A strainer is a device designed to separate unwanted particles from a mixture, typically in fluid or gas flow.

Working Principle of a Strainer:
The working principle of a strainer is straightforward. Regardless of the type of strainer used, recognizing both the input and output is essential. When correctly attached, the fluid seamlessly flows through the filter housing into the suction section. The strainer captures all the flow and suspended materials in one place, blocking unwanted particles.

Key Steps:
1.The fluid departs from the inlet and enters the basket strainer.
2.Debris such as soil, particles, and trash gets collected in the basket strainer.
3.A pressure differential activates the warning once blockage occurs.
4.The strainer design allows for either shutting down the pipe mechanism or directing the flow to the next basket strainer.

Types of Strainers:
Duplex Basket Strainer: Offers continuous filtration with dual baskets, ensuring uninterrupted operation and easy maintenance.
Simplex Basket Strainer: Provides effective straining with a single basket, suitable for applications where periodic maintenance is feasible.
Y Strainer: Utilizes a Y-shaped configuration for efficient filtration, commonly employed in pipelines to strain out unwanted particles and debris.
